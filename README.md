# code_snippets
Series of code snippets (mostly classes) written primarily in C++

More code to come!  

Currently in progress:
 - class_Smooth - for smoothing of data (current personal intended use is for smoothing analog input data from ESP32 touch input values)

Possibly planned:
 - Nothing here yet...
